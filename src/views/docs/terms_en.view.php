		<p><strong> Severability. </strong>No failure to exercise, and no delay in exercising, on the part of Company, any privilege, any power or any rights hereunder will operate as a waiver thereof, nor will any single or partial exercise of any right or power hereunder preclude further exercise of any other right hereunder.

		<p>In the event that the above exemption from liability does not uphold, the Company&rsquo;s aggregate liability to Licensee and/or any third party (claiming through Licensee) shall never exceed the financial amount actually paid by Licensee to Company for the Software. Furthermore, Company shall in no event be liable towards Licensee and/or any third party (claiming through Licensee) for any indirect damages, including but not limited to loss of profits, income, savings, or any other consequential, incidental, special, punitive damage, whether arising in contract, tort, warranty, or otherwise.</p>

            <br>
            <strong>14. Infringement.</strong>
        </p>
		<p>During any term of this EULA, if any portion of the Software is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to infringe any third party intellectual property rights and Licensee incurs a liability or expense as a result of such holding, then the Licensee's sole remedy shall be, and Company will, at its option: (i) obtain the right for Licensee to continue to use the Software consistent with this EULA; (ii) modify the Software so that it is non-infringing; or (iii) replace the infringing component with a non-infringing component, or (iv) refund all money paid in the then-current calendar quarter under this EULA and all of Licensee's rights and licenses under this EULA shall automatically terminate.</p>
